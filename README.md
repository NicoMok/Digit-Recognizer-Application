Digit Recognizer Application

I've used MNIST data (see link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/midhunlalvs/digit-recognizer-mnist-dataset-with-cnn-99?scriptVersionId=140764293) to train a neural network consisting of 2 hidden layers (each with 150 neurons) and an output layer (with 10 neurons). The neural network predicts digits with 96% accuracy.

I've incorporated the neural network model into a GUI application that prompts the user to draw a digit. Upon clicking the button "Recognize Digit", the application will recognize the digit written by the user.
